    Mineral sunscreens (also referred to as physical), which use only inorganic compounds (zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide) as active ingredients. These ingredients primarily work by absorbing UV rays but also through reflection and refraction.
Chemical sunscreens, which use organic molecules as active ingredients. These products are sometimes referred to as petrochemical sunscreens since the active organic molecules are synthesized starting from building blocks typically derived from petroleum.Chemical sunscreen ingredients also mainly work by absorbing the UV rays.Over the years, some organic UV absorbers have been heavily scrutinised to assess their toxicity[9] and a few of them have been banned in places such as Hawaii and Thailand for their impact on aquatic life and the environment.
Hybrid sunscreens, which contain a combination of organic and inorganic UV filters.
